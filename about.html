                <p>
                    For about 4 years, I've been dabbling into photography; I don't consider myself to be the greatest and I don't put

                <p>
                    As you've maybe noticed from the pictures above, one of my passions is actually cars, and I do enjoy driving.

                    I have been lucky in this matter, as my father works with cars and I got a chance to drive some pretty cool ones like:
